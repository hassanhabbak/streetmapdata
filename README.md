# OpenStreetMap

In this project, we are to select a city from https://www.openstreetmap.org and use the skills and techniques for data wrangling and cleaning to shape and audit the dataset. The data accuracy and consistensy will be assesed and adjusted as needed. Mongodb will be used to store our dataset and then queried for analytics.

# The dataset
Amsterdam is the city that we will audit and clean. Amsterdam is a major city in the Netherlands and where I live. It is considered to be one of the densest cities in Europe, so it will be interesting to see how clean its data in open street map is.
